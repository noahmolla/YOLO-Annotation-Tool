# Inference Engine
# You need either 'tensorflow' or 'tflite-runtime'.
# 
# OPTION 1 (Recommended): Use TensorFlow (easier to install, ~500MB)
tensorflow>=2.8.0,<2.18.0
# 
# OPTION 2: Use tflite-runtime (smaller, ~5MB, but harder to install on Windows)
# Uncomment the line below and comment out tensorflow above if you want the lighter option:
# tflite-runtime>=2.5.0
#
# Note: On Windows, tflite-runtime may require manual wheel installation.
# See: https://www.tensorflow.org/lite/guide/python

# OPTION 3: PyTorch YOLO models (.pt files) - RECOMMENDED for most users
# Provides native YOLO support with pretrained models (YOLOv8, YOLOv11, etc.)
ultralytics>=8.0.0

# Note: Comment out the line above if you only want to use TFLite models
